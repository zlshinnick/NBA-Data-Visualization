# NBA-Data-Visualization
NBA Optimal Player Body Type Visualization 

A python visualisation project which was undertaken to answer the question “What is the optimal body type for an NBA player” by investigating the correlation of different player production measures with biological factor including height, weight and BMI.

Investigated NBA stat API and filtered through every NBA player statistic since 1996 (over 11,00 players) to determine the body type most likely to have a successful NBA career.

Created visualizations with packages seaborn and matplotlib to present findings.

Findgins can be found in Final Presentation and Final Report files.
